        <p>I'm a software developer with a tech stack based in the JavaScript programming language. I also have a bachelor's in system engineering and a cybersecurity manager specialist that has worked in Financial services companies for 4 years. My experience as a system engineer allows me to understand, design, and develop large-scale applications that will be consumed by future clients with deep care about security while doing it.</p>
